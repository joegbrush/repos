## TDD, Test Driven Development, Testing in javascript

    Mocha, Jasmine, Tape, and Jest are a few testers.

    All testers are mostly the same.

    Writing tests is less about the syntax and more about the TDD philosophy. The most important issues are knowing why we write tests and what we test rather than how.

    TDD is one way of thinking through your design before writing all of your functional code.

    Add a test,fail, makes changes until code passes that test, continue development

    New things become less scary the more you use them.

    	Code always feels simple at the start but it doesn't stay simple. Testing keeps the complexity of code from overwhelming us.

    	Can be beneficial to write test first. Causes you to think more about your code.

    	Triangulation method = validating data through verification from more than two sources.
